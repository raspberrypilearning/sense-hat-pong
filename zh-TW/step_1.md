## Introduction

In this activity you will create a Pong game using your Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and some Python code. Pong is one of the oldest graphical games ever created, and was originally played on an oscilloscope! <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzEBOjvA11w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>

### What you will make

Open the trinket below to try out the game. Use your keyboard's arrow keys to control the paddle. Don't let the ball touch the edge or you will lose the game! <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/546e658d41?outputOnly=true&runOption=run&start=result" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>

### What you will learn
By coding a Pong game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn how to:

- Illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- Detect movements of the Sense HAT joystick

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):
