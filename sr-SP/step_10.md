## You lose

If you miss the ball with the bat, at the moment it bounces off the far left wall. Let's change the code so that if the player misses the ball, they lose the game.

+ Add another if statement at the end of your `draw_ball` function to check whether the ball's `x` position equals `0`, which would mean the ball has reached the far end of the screen.

+ If this condition is true, display the message "You lose".

Your new if statement will look very similar to the conditions you have already written. Add it here:

Here is how your code should look. The part to add is highlighted in blue:

+ Save and run your code. Check that, if you miss the ball, the message "You lose" appears. The game will restart after the message has been displayed.
