## Challenge: add more features

+ Add a score which increases each time the ball bounces off the bat. Report the score to the player when they lose.

+ Make the game easier or harder by changing the length of the `sleep` period in the while loop.

+ Give the player three lives: each time they miss the ball, they lose a life and the ball resets. Once all lives are lost, the game ends.
